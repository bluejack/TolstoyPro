# TolstoyPro

*A serious writing app for serious writers.*

### Notes

This project is intended as my own writing app, and while you could download and build it, it requires a full integration with Google -- under your own domain -- to be testable. So, there's probably not a huge benefit in having this project "open source." Still, it's here for my own backup, versioning, and reference, and if someone finds some use in it, that's great too!
